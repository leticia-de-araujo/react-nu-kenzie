## Nu-Kenzie ðŸ’³

This project was my first in <b>React.js</b>. The goal was to create a bank interface where you could add financial transactions and check your current balance. 

Some basic concepts of React.js were used, such as components, props, state, and conditional rendering.

<b>Technologies used:</b>
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
